# RoR1-recipefinder
Final assignment from the Coursera Ruby on Rails specialization course 1. 
The app is hosted on heroku. Go to http://recipe-finder1325.herokuapp.com/.
It's rather rustic, to search for other ingredients append "?search=ingredient" to the end of the URL.
For instance, http://recipe-finder1325.herokuapp.com/?search=salmno
